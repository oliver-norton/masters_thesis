# Master's thesis code

In this respository you can read the code which I used to do my master's thesis. Sensitive information has been removed.The code used here is a combination of my own code, and some from a toolkit published by:

Martin-Gutierrez, S., Losada, J. C., & Benito, R. M. (2023). Multipolar social systems: Measuring polarization beyond dichotomous contexts. Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, 169, 113244.

The thesis is not publicly available, however the code here and this readme will help explain the processed involved, from collection to analysis.
